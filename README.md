# Terraform 

## Overview

This project aims to take a new linux mint (the flavor I like best) environment and have it feel like home as quickly as possible

Terraform includes the following:

## Programs

* urxvt-256 color

  This is an alternative terminal to the gnome terminal which comes preinstalled with mint.  It has the advantage of being very configurable

* tmux

  Terminal Multiplexer.  This provides support for multiple panes in the terminal and allows attaching and detaching sessions (very handy for ssh)

* zsh

  A better shell

* htop

  A better top

* mutt

* gnupg

* ag - the silver searcher

  A very nice fuzzy find algorithm.  It is very fast and can be used in conjunction with things like grep or ag.

* LaTeX

  An awesome formatter.
